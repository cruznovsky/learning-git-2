    <h1>Linkin Park - Burn It Down</h1>
    <p>The cycle repeated
        As explosions broke in the sky
        All that I needed
        Was the one thing I couldn't find

        And you were there at the turn
        Waiting to let me know

        We're building it up
        To break it back down
        We're building it up
        To burn it down
        We can't wait
        To burn it to the ground

        The colors conflicted
        As the flames climbed into the clouds
        I wanted to fix this
        But couldn't stop from tearing it down</p>
