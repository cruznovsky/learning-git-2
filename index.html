                <p><span class="first-part">The cycle repeated<br>
                        As explosions broke in the sky<br>
                        All that I needed<br>
                        Was the one thing I couldn't find</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>And you were there at the turn<br>
                        Waiting to let me know</span><br>

                        To break it back down<br>
                        We're building it up<br>
                        To burn it down<br>
                        We can't wait<br>
                        To burn it to the ground</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>The colors conflicted<br>
                        As the flames climbed into the clouds<br>
                        I wanted to fix this<br>
                        But couldn't stop from tearing it down</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>And you were there at the turn<br>
                        Caught in the burning glow<br>
                        And I was there at the turn<br>
                        Waiting to let you know</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>We're building it up<br>
                        To break it back down<br>
                        We're building it up<br>
                        To burn it down<br>
                        We can't wait<br>
                        To burn it to the ground</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>You told me yes / You held me high<br>
                        And I believed when you told that lie<br>
                        I played soldier / You played king<br>
                        And struck me down when I kissed that ring<br>
                        You lost that right / to hold that crown<br>
                        I built you up but you let me down<br>
                        So when you fall / I'll take my turn<br>
                        And fan the flames as your blazes burn</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>And you were there at the turn<br>
                        Waiting to let me know</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>We're building it up<br>
                        To break it back down<br>
                        We're building it up<br>
                        To burn it down<br>
                        We can't wait<br>
                        To burn it to the ground</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>When you fall / I'll take my turn<br>
                        And fan the flames as your blazes burn</span><br>
                    <br>

                    <span>When you fall / I'll take my turn<br>
                        And fan the flames as your blazes burn</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span>We can't wait<br>
                        To burn it to the ground</span></p><br>
