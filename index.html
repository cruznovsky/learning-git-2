    <h1>Linkin Park - Burn It Down</h1>
    <p>The cycle repeated
        As explosions broke in the sky
        All that I needed
        Was the one thing I couldn't find

        And you were there at the turn
        Waiting to let me know

        We're building it up
        To break it back down
        We're building it up
        To burn it down
        We can't wait
        To burn it to the ground

        The colors conflicted
        As the flames climbed into the clouds
        I wanted to fix this
        But couldn't stop from tearing it down
    
    And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me yes / You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier / You played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right / to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall / I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know</p>
