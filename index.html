            <h1>Linkin Park - Burn It Down</h1>
            <p><span>The cycle repeated<br>
                    As explosions broke in the sky<br>
                    All that I needed<br>
                    Was the one thing I couldn't find</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>And you were there at the turn<br>
                    Waiting to let me know</span><br>

                <span>We're building it up<br>
                    To break it back down<br>
                    We're building it up<br>
                    To burn it down<br>
                    We can't wait<br>
                    To burn it to the ground</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>The colors conflicted<br>
                    As the flames climbed into the clouds<br>
                    I wanted to fix this<br>
                    But couldn't stop from tearing it down</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>And you were there at the turn<br>
                    Caught in the burning glow<br>
                    And I was there at the turn<br>
                    Waiting to let you know</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>We're building it up<br>
                    To break it back down<br>
                    We're building it up<br>
                    To burn it down<br>
                    We can't wait<br>
                    To burn it to the ground</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>You told me yes / You held me high<br>
                    And I believed when you told that lie<br>
                    I played soldier / You played king<br>
                    And struck me down when I kissed that ring<br>
                    You lost that right / to hold that crown<br>
                    I built you up but you let me down<br>
                    So when you fall / I'll take my turn<br>
                    And fan the flames as your blazes burn</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>And you were there at the turn<br>
                    Waiting to let me know</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>We're building it up<br>
                    To break it back down<br>
                    We're building it up<br>
                    To burn it down<br>
                    We can't wait<br>
                    To burn it to the ground</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>When you fall / I'll take my turn<br>
                    And fan the flames as your blazes burn</span><br>
                <br>
